//! v0.8.26 (architecture round 1, PLAN §64): the FAST-TIER subsystem. ONE struct owning the
//! scattered fast-decode-tier state so its folder-swap clearing happens BY CONSTRUCTION — a single
//! [`FastTier::on_folder_swap`] — instead of the hand-maintained checklist in `apply_scan` that
//! history keeps proving fragile (the §61 `frost_map` miss; the v0.8.13→15 delete-identity episode).
//! `main()` used to clone ~4 separate fast handles into the tick closure and thread them through the
//! `step_*` signatures; they now live here and one `Rc<FastTier>` clones in.
//!
//! BEHAVIOR-IDENTICAL: this round MOVES state and changes NO logic. The four stores keep the exact
//! interior-mutability discipline they had as loose handles; the clearing semantics below match the
//! pre-extraction `apply_scan` lines byte-for-byte (proven by `cargo test` + a boot-metric parity
//! spike on the testkit + the 66-shot folder).
//!
//! MEMBERSHIP (the conservative boundary — only unambiguously fast-tier-OWNED, swap-cleared state):
//!   • `cache`     — the fast scrub-tier VRAM textures (the [`tick::FastCache`] map: id → decoded
//!                   frame texture + kept blur mip). UI-thread-only (was `Rc<RefCell<…>>`).
//!   • `uploading` — ids currently in flight on the upload thread (was `uploading_fast`); prefetch +
//!                   readiness treat them as in-progress, the drain/Failed-reply clears them (gen-
//!                   checked, so a stale-folder result never resurrects one). UI-thread-only.
//!   • `failed`    — the (gen, idx) fast-decode failure latch (was `fast_failed`): a source whose
//!                   fast decode Err'd (corrupt file, or an HEIC with no OS HEVC extension) is asked
//!                   ONCE per folder instead of re-queued every tick (the retry-storm guard). The
//!                   POOL WORKERS insert off-thread → it stays `Arc<Mutex<…>>`.
//!   • `pump`      — the nearest-first prefetch request queue + the set currently decoding
//!                   ([`Pump`]). The POOL WORKERS pop from it off-thread → `Arc<(Mutex, Condvar)>`.
//!
//! DELIBERATELY OUT (shared with other tiers, or not swap-cleared — see the round-1 report):
//!   `fast_super` (sampling-mode atomic, also read by bench + the gamut handler), `fast_decodes` /
//!   `frost_misses` (perf-line counters, reset per perf-window not per-swap), `fast_budget` (co-
//!   managed with `detail_budget` inside the `VramTier`), `scrub_dim_atomic` (retargeted by
//!   step_adaptive_res), the `Decoded` result channel, and the RAM `L2` (its own module — explicitly
//!   out of scope this round). Folding any of these in is a mechanical follow-up.
