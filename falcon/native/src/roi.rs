//! v0.8.31 (architecture round 3, PLAN §64): the ROI / ZOOM-TIER subsystem. ONE struct owning the
//! scattered adaptive-hi-res (zoomed-region) decode-tier state so its clearing happens BY CONSTRUCTION —
//! the same two-path pattern [`crate::DetailTier`] established in round 2 — instead of the hand-maintained
//! checklists in `apply_scan` + `drop_developed_caches` + the develop-config handlers that history keeps
//! proving fragile (the §61 `frost_map` miss; the v0.8.13→15 delete-identity episode). `main()` used to
//! clone FOUR separate ROI handles into the tick closure and thread them through the `step_roi_*`
//! signatures; they now live here and one `Rc<RoiZoom>` clones in.
//!
//! BEHAVIOR-IDENTICAL: this round MOVES state and changes NO logic. The four stores keep the exact
//! interior-mutability discipline they had as loose handles (`failed` stays `Arc<Mutex>` for the ROI pool
//! worker that inserts into it off-thread; the other three are UI-thread-only `Rc<RefCell>`). The clearing
//! semantics below match the pre-extraction lines byte-for-byte (proven by `cargo test` + a boot-metric
//! parity spike on the testkit + a 43-shot folder).
//!
//! MEMBERSHIP (the conservative boundary — only unambiguously ROI-tier-OWNED, swap/develop-cleared state):
//!   • `tiles`  — the decoded hi-res zoom tiles (current viewport + pre-loaded neighbours), each an
//!                output-gamut-converted SOURCE crop, LRU by bytes. The [`RoiTile`] vector. This is the
//!                ONE ROI store `drop_developed_caches` drops (colour-managed → output-gamut-dependent).
//!                UI-thread-only (was `roi_tiles`).
//!   • `region` — the overlay descriptor ([`RegionState`]) for the tiles currently shown (which shot +
//!                normalised rect they cover, so the overlay texture isn't re-set every frame). Cleared in
//!                LOCKSTEP with `tiles` at every site (the overlay is meaningless without its tiles) but it
//!                is NOT a colour cache, so it was never inside `drop_developed_caches` — it is a
//!                swap-EXTRA here + a direct field at the develop-config handlers. UI-thread-only (was
//!                `roi_region`).
//!   • `failed` — the (gen, idx) ROI-decode failure latch (mirrors `fast_failed`/`thumb_failed`): a source
//!                whose full decode fails (over-cap panorama, corrupt file) stops being re-requested +
//!                re-read for the folder (the retry-storm guard, ROI edition). The POOL WORKER inserts
//!                off-thread → it stays `Arc<Mutex<…>>` (was `roi_failed`). Cleared on swap only.
//!   • `src`    — the per-shot UNORIENTED source-dimension memo (a cheap header probe), read by the focus
//!                / 1:1 zoom math + `step_zoom_pct` so the true source long-side is known without
//!                re-opening the file on the UI thread. UI-thread-only (was `roi_src`). Cleared on swap
//!                only.
//!
//! DELIBERATELY OUT (shared with other consumers, not folder-swap-cleared, channel/atomic plumbing, or not
//! a UI-thread handle at all — see the round-3 report):
//!   `roi_busy` (the one-region-decode-in-flight `AtomicBool` tick↔worker handshake — the WORKER itself
//!   resets it on a stale-gen request; NOT swap-cleared — direct parity with round-2's `det_busy`),
//!   `roi_max` / `roi_ss` / `roi_base` (the zoom-tile cap / super-sample factor / decode floor — VRAM-
//!   budget TIER state co-managed with `fast_budget`/`detail_budget`/`detail_cap` inside the `VramTier`
//!   value-struct + rewritten by the OOM-recovery / dev sim-VRAM control — parity with the budgets both
//!   prior rounds parked), the ROI request/result CHANNELS (`roi_req_tx`, `roi_res_rx`, `roi_yuv_res_rx` —
//!   plumbing, parity with the `Detail`/`Decoded` channels FastTier/DetailTier excluded), the zoom/pan
//!   GESTURE + motion state (`last_view` motion-detect, `roi_settle` settle timer, `pan_carry` zoom-
//!   persistence, `pan_at_press` press anchor — DISPLAY/INPUT state read by non-ROI-tier steps, e.g.
//!   `step_display` consumes `pan_carry`; none is a swap/develop-cleared cache), and the ROI WORKER's own
//!   thread-LOCAL CPU source caches (`sources` / `sources_yuv` / `src_dims`) with their
//!   `custom_profile_gen` guard — those live inside the worker closure, are never UI-thread handles, and
//!   are untouched by this extraction (the guard's read/write sites stay byte-identical). Folding any of
//!   these in is a mechanical follow-up.
