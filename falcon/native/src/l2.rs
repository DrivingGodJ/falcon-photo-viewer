//! v0.7.7 RAM L2 keep-alive cache (PLAN §57, stages 1–3). A plain, UI-thread-owned store of
//! decoded fast-tier frames (source-gamut RGBA + the frosted-blur mip) kept ALIVE in RAM after
//! their VRAM texture is evicted, so a frame the user already visited never re-decodes: a backward
//! pass / direction flip re-uploads FROM RAM (create_texture only) instead of paying the
//! ~200 ms Huffman-bound JPEG decode again.
//!
//! Zero-copy: the bytes arrive wrapped in `Arc<[u8]>` straight off the decode pool (the upload
//! thread wraps `d.rgba` BEFORE create_texture), so a deposit is a pointer move and a hit is a
//! pointer clone — never a memcpy of the multi-MB frame.
//!
//! Stage 2 adds the RAM-PRESSURE CONTROLLER: the store keeps a NOMINAL budget (fixed at boot,
//! min(25% RAM, 8 GiB)) and a live EFFECTIVE budget the controller steps down under system memory
//! pressure and back up when calm — mirroring the VRAM-OOM degrade/restore pattern, but pure and
//! self-contained here so it unit-tests without a live probe. See [`L2Store::pressure_sample`].
//!
//! Pure logic only (no wgpu/Slint) — unit-tested below. The `ram_l2` flag is consulted at the
//! DEPOSIT + HIT call sites (mirroring how `async_blur` gates in the worker), so these methods stay
//! flag-free and directly testable; when the flag is OFF nothing is deposited and the Arcs simply
//! drop (byte-identical to the pre-L2 path). The controller's runtime-disable state is INSIDE the
//! store (deposits/hits no-op while disabled) since it must gate every call site identically.

/// kept at its 4096 DCT stop is still tagged 3840, so it satisfies want=3840 and does NOT
/// falsely satisfy a later want=4096.
///
/// v0.8.101 (S1 caveat): [`falcon_decode::PREVIEW_CACHE_DIM`] is the one value OUTSIDE that

/// The scrub tier's own question is [`dim_satisfies`] alone, and that is right for it: the bucket is
/// the WANT the bytes were decoded for, both sampling tiers share one bucket, and `Decoded::sup`
/// discriminates them. A SECOND tier reading the same bucket cannot lean on that. On the SUBSAMPLE
/// tier an ordinary fast frame is filed under want 2880 while its pixels are ~1440 — honest inside
/// the fast tier, and a soft picture presented as the sharp one if the full-res tier took the bucket
/// at its word. So this asks the bucket AND the pixels, and the pixel term is the one that makes it
/// safe: a frame whose long side does not reach the full-res target is refused and the detail worker
/// decodes as it always did.
///
/// The cost of the pixel term is that a source SMALLER than the full-res target is never served from

/// # v0.8.172 (G1) — THE TWO TERMS THE SIZE TEST COULD NOT CARRY, AND WHY SIZE ALONE WAS A DEFECT
///
/// v0.8.170 asked the bucket and the pixels and NOTHING ELSE, and gated the whole consult on the
/// lever alone (`ram_l2 && heic_one_decode()`). Every one of the following then qualified as "the
/// sharp frame", because every one of them is an ordinary L2 resident whose bucket and pixels reach
/// the full-res target:
///
///   * **A RAW+JPG pair in RAW mode.** The fast tier is ALWAYS the finished JPG; the full-res tier
///     develops the RAW. Its L2 entry is the JPG, and it was published as the RAW's sharp frame.
///   * **A plain scrub frame on a maximized laptop window**, where `scrub want == ddim == 2560`, i.e.
///     in exactly the band the boot line calls "inert" — the routing gate declines (`detail > scrub`
///     is false) so no master is ever banked, and the ordinary fast frame served in its place.
///   * **A WIC decode-at-scale HEIC frame** on a folder the lane DECLINES: never hardware, never a
///     master, same size, served.
///   * **A resident parked under a different `res_limit`.** The consult read `det_epoch` LIVE at
///     enqueue and stamped it onto the job, so the drain's `epoch != det_epoch_now` guard compared
///     the live value against itself — structurally a no-op for a stale deposit.
///
/// So the resident now carries what it always needed to: **`master`**, set by the drain's master
/// deposit ALONE — which by construction exists only for a hardware-lane HEIC that passed
/// [`crate::support::hw_one_decode_want`] — and **`epoch`**, the develop-config token that was live
/// WHEN THE BYTES WERE PARKED. Every toggle that changes what "the full-res frame" means (RAW mode,
/// output gamut, res limit, adaptive hi-res, Simulate VRAM) bumps `det_epoch`, so a stale resident
