//! v0.8.32 (architecture round 4, PLAN §64): the FILM / thumbnail / frost subsystem — the FINAL
//! extraction of the §64 chain. ONE struct owning the scattered filmstrip/Selection thumbnail + frost-
//! mip state so its folder-swap clearing happens BY CONSTRUCTION — a single [`Film::on_folder_swap`] —
//! instead of the hand-maintained checklist in `apply_scan` that history keeps proving fragile (the §61
//! `frost_map` stale-read bug — THIS very map; the v0.8.13→15 delete-identity episode). `main()` used to
//! clone FOUR separate film handles into the tick closure and thread them through the `step_*`
//! signatures; they now live here and one `Rc<Film>` clones in.
//!
//! BEHAVIOR-IDENTICAL: this round MOVES state and changes NO logic. The four stores keep the exact
//! interior-mutability discipline they had as loose handles (`thumbs`/`pending` are UI-thread-only
//! `Rc<RefCell>`; `frost`/`failed` stay `Arc<Mutex>` — the thumb POOL WORKERS insert into BOTH off-
//! thread, and the FAST decode pool READS `frost`). The clearing semantics below match the pre-
//! extraction `apply_scan` lines byte-for-byte (proven by `cargo test` + a boot-metric parity spike on
//! the testkit + the 66-shot folder).
//!
//! GAMUT PATH (v0.8.104, Round-A C2 — this paragraph used to read "SINGLE-PATH: the film tier has NO
//! develop/gamut clearing path"). Thumbnails were the last CM-BYPASS surface showing SHARP photo pixels:
//! the filmstrip and the Selection grid blitted SOURCE-gamut bytes beside a correctly-converted stage.
//! (v0.8.105 / W1 corrects the v0.8.104 wording, which claimed they were the last CM-bypass surface
//! FULL STOP — the frosted backdrop was still one, and is colour-managed at its composite now.) They are
//! baked into the output gamut by the thumb worker and stamped with `support::cm_bake_key`, so `thumbs`
//! IS a developed cache — one that carries its bake key per entry (`tick::ThumbEntry`).
//! v0.8.105 (W2/W4): `tick::regamut_invalidate_thumbs` therefore clears only `pending` and bumps
//! `thumb_gen`; it does NOT empty the map. Emptying it blanked every tile in the strip and the grid to
//! the "…" placeholder (their only fallback, the fast cache, is cleared on the same line) for the
//! 208–434 ms × N a re-decode of the visible window costs, AND it orphaned frost mips — `drain_thumbs`
//! evicts those by iterating THIS map's keys, so a mip whose index left it became unevictable (~40 MB
//! per switch). Instead `lookup_thumb` shows a stale-key tile while re-requesting it, the drain
//! overwrites it when the correct bake lands, and `drain_thumbs` also carries a cap check over
//! `frost`'s own keys so its bound no longer depends on this map at all. `frost` stays
//! gamut-INDEPENDENT on purpose — the blur mip is derived from the UNTRANSFORMED
//! decode, matching the mip the fast tier builds from its own source-gamut frame — so it is not cleared
//! by the gamut sweep. `drop_developed_caches` still touches NONE of these four stores (its signature is
//! fast/detail/roi/l2 only); the film arm is its named sibling. The rotation invalidation
//! POKES `thumbs`/`pending` per-index (`rotate_invalidate`) or folder-wide (`rotate_invalidate_all`), but
//! that is a targeted EVICTION, not a folder clear, and stays a cross-tier free fn reading `&film.<field>`
//! (byte-identical call sites). So `on_folder_swap` is the ONE clearing method — simpler than the two-path
//! DetailTier/RoiZoom, matching the round-1 FastTier shape — and there is NO double-clear to reason about.
//!
//! MEMBERSHIP (the conservative boundary — only unambiguously film-tier-OWNED, swap-cleared state):
//!   • `thumbs`  — the filmstrip/Selection thumbnail image cache (idx → (decoded `slint::Image`, the
//!                 CM bake key its pixels were converted for — `tick::ThumbEntry`, v0.8.105/W2); small
//!                 CPU images in RAM, independent of the VRAM-budgeted fast cache so the strip fills on
//!                 any machine). UI-thread-only (was `thumb_cache`).
//!   • `pending` — ids with a thumb decode in flight; dedups so a thumb is decoded at most once. The
//!                 thumb worker's ALWAYS-answer rule frees the slot on every reply (decoded OR failure
//!                 marker). UI-thread-only (was `thumb_pending`).
//!   • `frost`   — A3 (§61): the shared thumb-derived frosted-blur mip map (idx → (mip bytes, w, h, the
//!                 SOURCE gamut those pixels were downscaled from — `tick::FrostMap`, v0.8.106)). The
//!                 thumb pool workers INSERT (after each 256 px thumb decode); the FAST decode pool READS
//!                 it to skip the ~20 % per-frame `downscale_rgba` tax; the UI tick EVICTS it in LOCKSTEP
//!                 with `thumbs` (drain_thumbs, bounded to the same keys) + CLEARS on swap. Worker-shared
//!                 → `Arc<Mutex>` (the [`tick::FrostMap`] alias). Was `frost_map`. The fast pool is a
//!                 READER, not a co-owner — like `failed`'s cross-tier reader (step_cloud_retry), that
//!                 doesn't make the store fast-owned: it is produced-by-thumbs, evicted-with-thumbs,
//!                 swap-cleared-with-thumbs.
//!   • `failed`  — the (gen, idx) THUMBNAIL-decode failure latch (mirrors fast/detail/roi `failed`): a
//!                 file whose thumb decode Err'd is asked ONCE per folder instead of leaking a `pending`
//!                 slot forever + a permanently-black tile (the stuck-TIFF-thumbnail report). Keyed
//!                 (gen, idx) so a stale-folder failure can't blacklist the same index in the next folder
//!                 — the race-free keying discipline is SACRED (matches fast/roi `failed`). The thumb POOL
//!                 WORKER inserts off-thread → `Arc<Mutex>`. Was `thumb_failed`.
//!   • `pinned`  — v0.8.42 (Selection demand-loading): the shot indices currently VISIBLE in the open
//!                 Selection panel's grid viewport (+ a small row margin). `drain_thumbs` EXEMPTS these
//!                 from the farthest-from-anchor eviction (which used to empty exactly the tiles the
//!                 user was looking at once they browsed far from their picks on a >THUMB_CACHE_MAX
//!                 folder). Fed wholesale each tick by `step_selection` from the grid's live viewport;
//!                 EMPTY whenever the panel is closed (zero pinning by contract) and cleared on swap
//!                 like every owned store (the indices are folder-scoped). UI-thread-only `RefCell`.
//!
//! DELIBERATELY OUT (monotonic/not-swap-cleared signal, display-input state, or channel/atomic plumbing —
//! see the round-4 report):
//!   `thumb_gen` (the thumbnail-ARRIVAL generation `Rc<Cell<u64>>` — MONOTONIC, never reset per-folder
//!   [verified: `apply_scan` never touches it]; bumped by `drain_thumbs` on every current-folder landing
//!   + by `rotate_invalidate_all`, read by the filmstrip/Selection rebuild KEYS. It is the film-domain
//!   analogue of `det_epoch`/`fast_super`/`roi_busy` — a generation SIGNAL, not a swap-cleared cache — so
//!   it stays a loose handle exactly as those three did; folding it in would give `Film` a field
//!   `on_folder_swap` must NOT clear, breaking the clean "swap clears every owned field" invariant the
//!   template is built on). The thumb request/result CHANNELS (`thumb_req_tx` / `thumb_res_rx` — plumbing,
//!   parity with every prior round's channels). The `frost_thumb` gate + `frost_misses` counter (an
//!   `AtomicBool` config flag the pool reads off-thread + a per-perf-window counter reset per window, not
//!   per swap — cross-consumer/not-swap-cleared, parity with `fast_super`). And the filmstrip SCROLL /
//!   gesture DISPLAY state (`film_pos`, `film_base`, `film_follow`, `film_target`, `film_dragging`,
//!   `last_film_key` — input/display state consumed by non-film steps; RESET to a start-centred default on
//!   swap, not cleared, exactly like the `pan_carry` display-state precedent both prior rounds parked).
//!   Folding any of these in is a mechanical follow-up.
