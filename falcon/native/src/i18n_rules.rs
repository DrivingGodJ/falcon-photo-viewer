//! Plural rules for language packs, shared by `build.rs` (which writes Slint's `.po` headers) and
//! `i18n.rs` (which picks a Rust message's plural form). `scripts/check-translations.py` keeps a
//! copy of the ids and categories; `languages.json` names a rule by its `id`.

//! A rule's `categories` are CLDR plural category names in gettext form order: the form at index
//! `plural_index(n)` is the one gettext's `plural=` expression selects for `n`. Adding a rule means
//! adding a row here, a matching arm in `plural_index`, and the same row in the checker.
