//! v0.9.22: the macOS **menu-bar MODEL** — platform-neutral, pure, Windows-unit-tested.
//!
//! The native NSMenu realization lives in `mac_menu.rs` (cfg macOS); THIS file is the single source
//! of truth for the menu TREE (titles, tags, key equivalents, check state, structure) and the
//! ENABLEMENT predicate, computed from a plain `MenuSnapshot` the tick assembles each frame. The
//! split follows the round rule "cargo check never compiles cfg-test code": every menu DECISION is
//! testable on the Windows host; only the AppKit realization is compiler-blind here.
//!
//! ── THE ROUND'S BINDING DESIGN CONSTRAINTS (owner ruling, v0.9.22) ────────────────────────────────
//! * Only ⌘-chords are LIVE key equivalents (⌘, ⌘O ⌘W ⌘Z ⌘C ⌃⌘F — plus ⌘Q/⌘M outside this model:
//!   ⌘Q stays on muda's retargeted Quit item, ⌘M on the Window menu's standard Minimize). Bare cull
//!   keys are DISPLAY-ONLY: NSMenu cannot show a right-column key without registering it live (AppKit
//!   would then intercept unmodified keys before text fields), so they ride the title as a suffix in
//!   the natural form "Flag (P)" / "Rate ★★★ (3)". `live_equivalents_are_cmd_chords_only` PINS the
//!   invariant.
//! * Every displayed key renders from the LIVE keymap (`MenuKeys` is built via `support::
//!   menu_shortcut`, the same formatter the in-app context-menu chips and Settings rows use) — the
//!   tick rebuilds the snapshot each frame and the mac side re-titles on fingerprint change AND on
//!   menu open. No key string is hardcoded here.
//! * Enablement honesty (ledger L15): photo-dependent items disable in the empty state; Undo
//!   enables only when something is undoable; Sort/recents reflect the live state.
//!
//! Tags are stable i32s (NSMenuItem.tag); the dispatch match lives in main.rs's tick drain and
//! routes every tag to the SAME `invoke_*` callback the in-app control uses (single dispatch path).

// lookups plus a `recents` Vec<String> clone, cloned AGAIN into `mac_menu`'s mutex: ≈50 heap
// allocations 62.5×/s, forever, on a machine with no folder open. Only the AppKit refresh was
// fingerprint-gated; the allocation that FED the fingerprint was not. That is the best single
// explanation the round-4 evidence has for "energy impact 2.2 at No folder open".
//
// The gate below is the same hash, computed from inputs that allocate NOTHING:
//   * the snapshot's SCALAR state — hashed by handing this fn a `MenuSnapshot` whose two
//     collection fields are still empty (`String::new()` and `Vec::new()` never touch the heap),
//     which is why the caller builds the scalars FIRST and fills `keys`/`recents` only on a miss.
//     Rust's struct-literal exhaustiveness is what keeps that probe honest: a new field on
//     `MenuSnapshot` fails to compile at the tick's construction site until it is written there,
//     so a scalar can never quietly fall outside the gate.
//   * `keys_h` / `recents_h` — [`hash_keymap`] and [`hash_recents`] over the SOURCES the two
//     collections are derived from (the raw keybind map; the LRU's top-N paths), by reference.
//
// EQUAL FINGERPRINT ⇒ EQUAL SNAPSHOT, so a skipped tick leaves `mac_menu`'s stored snapshot
// CURRENT, not stale — `validateMenuItem:` reads exactly what it would have read. That is the
