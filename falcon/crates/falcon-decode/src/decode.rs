//! P5 (PLAN §65, the v0.9.x cross-platform transition): the finished-image decode layer behind a
//! trait, so a future macOS ImageIO decoder can slot in where Windows uses nvJPEG/WIC without
//! touching the render-worker call sites.
//!
//! The trait is deliberately narrow — exactly the two shapes the workers need:
//!   * [`ImageDecoder::decode_scaled`] — "≥ `target_long`, best-effort, caller finishes" (the
//!     display path). `target_long == 0` means native. This is today's `fast_frame_rgba` contract
//!     ([`crate::fast_frame_rgba`]); the caller applies the near-stop finish so CPU + accelerated
//!     decoders share ONE finish rule (see [`crate::near_stop_skip_resize`]).
//!   * [`ImageDecoder::decode_full`] — the native full-resolution RGB buffer the ROI/zoom cropper
//!     works from (fed to [`crate::crop_region_norm`]). RGB only — never YUV.
//!
//! There is **no** `decode_region`: the ROI worker stays decode-full + crop (`crop_region_norm` /
//! `crop_region_yuv`), per PLAN §65.
//!
//! Fallback is by RETURN VALUE, never `#[cfg]`: a decoder that can't handle a shot returns
//! [`DecodeError::Unsupported`] and the caller `.or_else`s onto the portable [`CpuDecoder`]. This is
//! what folds today's `use_nvjpeg` / `is_jpeg_source` / `yuv_enabled` gates into the decoder layer:
//! the app keeps the runtime `use_nvjpeg` toggle (it picks WHICH decoder instance a worker uses),
//! while "is this a JPEG the hardware unit accepts?" becomes an internal `Err(Unsupported)`.
//!
//! Layout preference is exposed by [`DecodeCaps::yields_yuv`]: only the nvJPEG decoder (a future
//! macOS twin would say `false`) yields planar YUV, and that flag is what lets a non-YUV build always
//! take the RGB(A) upload arm.
//!
//! The three universal implementors live here ([`CpuDecoder`], [`WicDecoder`]); the GPU one
//! (`NvJpegDecoder`) lives in `falcon-nvjpeg` (it wraps the CUDA context and depends on this trait),
//! and the future `ImageIODecoder` is its macOS analogue.
