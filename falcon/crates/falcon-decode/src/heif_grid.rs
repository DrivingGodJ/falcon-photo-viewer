//! v0.8.144 (E1) — the from-scratch ISO-BMFF HEIF **grid** parse: the container stage of the
//! hardware-decode epic (July 2026).
//!
//! # What this is, and what it deliberately is not
//!
//! Every iPhone HEIC the project has ever measured is a GRID: 45–54 independently-decodable HEVC
//! tiles plus a `grid` derived item that says how they compose. WIC hides all of that behind one
//! `GetSize`/`CopyPixels` pair, and pays for it with a pure-CPU decode (measured 712–994 ms at
//! 48 MP). The hardware routes cannot be fed at all without the tile map — a decoder session takes
//! *bitstreams*, not files — so before any of E2/E3 can exist, something has to read the container.
//! That is this module, and ONLY this module: it produces a **decode plan** and decodes nothing.
//!
//! It is also INERT. Nothing on the shipping decode path calls it unless `FALCON_HW_HEIC_PARSE=1`
//! is set, and even then all that happens is one diagnostic line per file through the existing
//! [`crate::note_once`] channel. `FALCON_CLASSIC_HEIC` is untouched and orthogonal.
//!
//! # Reuse, not a second dialect
//!
//! Box walking is [`crate::bmff_children`] — the same overflow-free walker the v0.8.105 preview
//! probe and the v0.8.106 (L28) crafted-`largesize` row already harden — and property association
//! is [`crate::bmff_ipma_entries`], which v0.8.144 EXTRACTED out of `heic_preview_colr` so the two
//! readers of `ipma` are one reader. The only new primitive here is [`Cur`], a checked byte cursor
//! for the *leaf* boxes (`iloc`, `iinf`, `ispe`, the grid payload) that `bmff_children` does not
//! model — it reads fields, not boxes, so it is not a competing box parser.
//!
//! # Colour is not decided here
//!
//! The gamut answer routes through the EXISTING oracle ([`crate::heic_color_tag`] →
//! `falcon_color::resolve_source_gamut`, i.e. the v0.8.141 two-pass `colr` rule) and this module
//! never re-implements one byte of that policy. The structural parser ([`parse_heif_grid`]) has no
//! colour answer AT ALL — that is why the plan splits in two: [`HeifGridPlan`] is what the bytes
//! say about geometry, and [`HeifDecodePlan`] is that plus the oracle's colour verdict, obtainable
//! only from the path door [`heif_decode_plan`]. The primary item's own `colr` body is carried
//! along as raw DATA (`primary_colr`) for E2/E3 to hand to the oracle — never as a second verdict.
//! L42 in the design ledger says never decide from a name when the answering bytes are in hand;
//! the twin of that rule is never grow a second decider, and this split is that twin made structural.
//!
//! # Fail closed, always
//!
//! Every entry point returns `Result` and every internal read is checked. A truncated `iloc`, an
//! absent `pitm`, an `ipma` index past the end of `ipco`, a `largesize` chosen to wrap the cursor —
//! all of them are `Err`, none of them panics. `heif_grid_fuzz_survives_byte_flips` hammers 5,000
//! single-byte mutations of a real container's head through [`parse_heif_grid`] and asserts the
//! same.

    // are attacker-chosen. `want` is `rows × cols` from `parse_image_grid`'s two `u8 + 1` fields, so
    // legitimately up to 65 536; `bmff_ipma_entries` reads its entry count from a `u32` and is
    // bounded only by the box's own byte span at ≥3 bytes per entry inside a 256 MB container. That
    // is 10⁹–10¹¹ comparisons a crafted few-MB HEIC could buy — and this parse is on the SHIPPING
    // hardware lane (`falcon_hwdec::tile_source` calls it, `hwheic.rs` calls that per decode
    // attempt), so the cost is a wedged fast-pool worker, per attempt, per visit.
    //
    // v0.8.153 (skeptic A / O3) — THERE ARE TWO MAPS, BECAUSE THE TWO READERS NEVER AGREED.
    //
    // v0.8.152 built one map and gave it the UNION on a repeated item id, on the reasoning that
    // "the union is the one that cannot hide an association". That is true of the INVENTORY, which
    // reports what it can see and whose two questions (`auxC`, `pixi`) are last-write-wins over a
    // list. It is false — and a REGRESSION — for `props_of`, whose readers are `irot`, `imir`,
    // `clap`, `ispe`, `pixi`, `colr` and each tile's `hvcC`: those are `match` arms that ASSIGN, so
    // concatenating a second entry's associations lets the LAST one win. A file with two legal
    // `ipma` boxes for the primary would decode with a different rotation, a different crop, or a
    // different parameter set than v0.8.151 gave it — which is the wrong-parameter-set class this
    // very epic's `tail_verified` gate exists to close.
    //
    // So `props_of` is FIRST-WINS — `entry().or_insert_with()`, exactly the old
    // `meta.ipma.iter().find(..)` — and `inventory` keeps the union it always had. Every real file
    // has exactly one entry per item, so on everything that is not crafted the two maps are equal.
