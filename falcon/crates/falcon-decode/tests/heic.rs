//! v0.8.101 (S1 + S2): the HEIC browse-lane strategy, tested against REAL iPhone files.
//!
//! # The skip-when-codec-absent pattern (read this before adding a row)
//!
//! Everything here needs the Windows Store HEVC/HEIF Image Extension — an OS component Falcon
//! deliberately does not vendor. On a machine without it (CI, a fresh laptop, macOS) these tests
//! must SKIP WITH A NOTE, never fail: a red test would be reporting the absence of a codec, not a
//! defect in Falcon, and a suite that cries wolf about the environment stops being read. So every
//! codec-dependent test opens with [`heic_shots_or_skip`], which prints exactly why it skipped.
//!
//! The corollary: a green run on a codec-less box proves NOTHING about S1/S2. The pure-arithmetic
//! rows below (`scaled_dims_matches_resize_to_long`, `classic_switch_reads_only_the_exact_flag`)
//! are the part that runs everywhere, and they are written to carry the invariants that CAN be
//! stated without pixels.
