//! v0.8.147 (E3 milestone 2) — **THE GATE**: whole real photos, real driver, real GPU, measured
//! against the path that ships.
//!
//! # What is a gate here and what is a report
//!
//! The plan's non-negotiable #4 makes one thing binary and one thing not. The DIMS are binary:
//! "dims byte-identical to `finish_source` per `scale_to`", and the only honest way to test that is
//! to ask the shipping WIC lane what it answers for the same file at the same tier and require the
//! same pair — which is what [`the_dims_are_the_shipping_paths_on_every_file_and_tier`] does, on
//! every corpus HEIC × every `scale_to` the browse lanes actually request. The PIXELS are not
//! binary: HEVC decode is bit-exact by spec, so the residual against WIC is entirely the two
//! converters' chroma reconstruction disagreeing, and pinning a tolerance on somebody else's
//! filter would be pinning their build. What IS tested about the pixels is the thing a tolerance
//! would hide: that the residual is FLAT ACROSS THE GRID. A compositor that places a tile wrong
//! produces a picture whose per-tile error is enormous in one cell and normal everywhere else, and
//! `the_grid_has_no_seam` is that statistic — with the falsifier beside it proving it bites.
//!
//! # The skip discipline
//!
//! These rows need a D3D11 video device, a GPU adapter, AND the corpus. Any of the three missing is
//! a SKIP WITH A NAMED REASON printed on the row, never a `cfg`-out — a test that cannot run is not
//! a gate. On the box this round was executed on (RTX 5080, driver 610.88) every row RAN.

// ── v0.8.149 (F9/B11): THE SKIP AUDIT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every row in this file can decline to run, and the E6 audit's point is that a suite which prints
// `test result: ok` while a third of it declined is not reporting what it did. The reason was
// already named at every site; what was missing is that nothing COUNTED them, so a green run on a
// box without the corpus and a green run that actually gated the epic were indistinguishable at a
// glance. `skip!` numbers each one and points at the inventory in TESTING.md §8h, and
// `the_skip_audit_states_what_this_machine_could_not_run` prints the total.

/// compute pass, so `pow` differs in the last ulp and the two land within a rounding step of each
/// other. What IS claimed is the acceptance criterion the round set: the new output is the colour
/// THE JPEG CHAIN ALREADY PRODUCES, because it is spliced from the same shader source
/// (`rot_uv_cm_core!`, asserted in `falcon-gpu`'s `the_heic_finish_pass_embeds_the_same_shared_core`)
/// and quantised by the same round-half-up rule (`pack`'s `floor(c + 0.5)` against
/// `apply_pixel`'s `(v * 255.0 + 0.5)`). The residual against the CPU arm is therefore reported as
/// three numbers per (file × tier × output gamut), not hidden behind a tolerance.
///
/// # The four output gamuts, and why each is there
///
///   * the SOURCE gamut itself — the pass-through arm. `transform_rgba` is a no-op when
///     `src == dst` and the shader's bit-1 arm refuses to round-trip through `linearize`/`encode`
///     for the same reason, so this row demands EXACT equality. It is what proves the new path
///     does not quietly re-encode a picture nobody asked it to touch.
///   * `AdobeRgb` and `Rec2020` — two real conversions of different sizes.
///   * `Custom` — **the owner's own case**, and the hard one: the destination TRC is not analytic
///     but a per-channel inverse LUT, fetched on the CPU by `Trc::Lut` and on the GPU by
///     `textureLoad` from the `CustomLutTex` built out of the SAME `custom_encode_lut` u16 table.
///     A profile is installed here so the row exercises that branch rather than the fallback.
///
/// # FALSIFIER (L28) — the mis-plumbed source gamut
///
/// The gate could pass vacuously if the source gamut never reached the shader at all (a uniform
/// packed wrong, a matrix left identity): both arms would then be doing "something with sRGB" and
/// might agree. So the row ALSO finishes the same canvas with `src` deliberately mis-declared as
/// `Gamut::Srgb` while the CPU arm converts from the file's real Display-P3, and asserts that the
/// delta EXCEEDS the gate by a wide margin. Delete the `c0/c1/c2` matrix rows from

    //  * NO RESAMPLE (the output IS the display size) — the DETAIL tier's own shape, and the one
    //    this wave actually changes: `ddim` is 8192 against an 8064 px photo, so both finish passes
    //    take their identity-copy arm. Both arms then see the IDENTICAL u8 mosaic pixel and the
    //    only thing that can differ is `powf` against WGSL `pow`. MEASURED on the RTX 5080:
    //    max 1, mean 0.0000, over1 0.00000% — on every output gamut INCLUDING the owner's Custom.
    //
    //  * RESAMPLED (the 2880 px fast ask) — here the two arms are not doing the same arithmetic,
    //    and the GPU arm is the MORE accurate of the two: it colour-manages the f32 Lanczos
    //    accumulator, while the CPU arm manages the u8 that accumulator was rounded to first. So
    //    the residual is a missing 8-bit quantisation step, amplified near black by a pure-power
    //    destination TRC (the effect `YUV_WGSL` names in its own chroma-offset comment: "~6 LSB
    //    near black through Adobe RGB's pure-power TRC"). It is the SAME accuracy argument U2's
    //    fused YUV path already ships on — "one fewer 8-bit quantisation than the RGBI path".
