//! v0.8.147 (E3 milestone 2) — **the HEIC grid's GPU assembly**: canvas compositing, the grid's
//! crop, `irot`/`imir`, the E2 kernel, and the tier downsample — one chain, one readback.
//!
//! # What this module is for
//!
//! E3-M1 (`falcon-hwdec`) decodes ONE tile at a time and hands back NV12. A 48 MP iPhone HEIC is a
//! 9 × 6 grid of 896 × 1024 tiles: 74 MB of NV12 that has to become one 8064 × 6048 RGB image,
//! rotated as the container says, at whatever size the asking tier wants. Doing that on the CPU
//! would mean a 74 MB composite, a 146 MB conversion and a 146 MB Lanczos — which is most of what
//! makes the existing WIC path cost 712–994 ms. So none of it happens on the CPU. The tiles are
//! written into a GPU canvas as they arrive, and the ONLY thing that comes back is the finished
//! RGB at the requested size.
//!
//! # The chain, in order, and where each of the contract's clauses lands
//!
//! The contract E3 must reproduce (plan non-negotiable #4) is: *packed RGB8, 24 bpp, stride `w*3`,
//! `irot` APPLIED, un-colour-managed in the file's gamut, dims byte-identical to `finish_source`
//! per `scale_to`.* Four passes answer it:
//!
//! 1. **COMPOSITE** — `queue.write_texture` per tile, at the tile's own mosaic origin, into two
//!    canvas textures: `R8Uint` at the mosaic's full size for luma and `Rg8Uint` at half for the
//!    interleaved chroma. There is no compositing *shader*: a tile's placement is a copy at an
//!    offset, and asking the GPU's copy engine for it is both faster and impossible to get subtly
//!    wrong in the way a hand-written blit can. The driver's stride is passed through as
//!    `bytes_per_row`, so a pitched decode surface is uploaded without a repack — E2 pinned that a
//!    stride cannot change the answer (`a_pitched_surface_matches_the_packed_one`).
//!
//!    **The canvas is NV12, not RGB, and that is the seam decision.** Composing in NV12 means the
//!    chroma upsample runs ACROSS tile boundaries — the pixel in mosaic column 895 takes half its
//!    chroma from tile 0's last chroma column and half from tile 1's first. Composing per-tile RGB
//!    instead would clamp each tile's upsample at its own edge and leave a real discontinuity on
//!    every one of the 13 internal seams of a 48 MP photo. The tiles are samples of ONE continuous
//!    image; treating them as one is both the correct reading and the seam-free one, and
//!    `tests/hw_photo.rs`'s seam hunt is what says so out loud.
//!
//! 2. **CONVERT** — [`crate::Nv12Kernel::encode`], the E2 kernel, over the whole mosaic, into a
//!    storage buffer of `r | g<<8 | b<<16` words. Not a fork and not a fusion: it is the same
//!    compiled pipeline `convert_with_coeffs` uses, called as a pass. Colour arithmetic still
//!    exists in exactly two places in this project.
//!
//! 3. **MAP + RESAMPLE-X** ([`FINISH_WGSL`]'s `main_h`) — the crop rect, `irot`, `imir` and the
//!    horizontal half of the downsample, all as ONE gather. Rotation is not a pass of its own
//!    because it is a coordinate map, and a coordinate map is free inside a gather that was going
//!    to index the source anyway; a separate rotate pass would have cost a 195 MB round trip
//!    through VRAM to move bytes that the resampler was about to read regardless.
//!
//! 4. **RESAMPLE-Y** (`main_v`) — the vertical half, skipped outright when the height does not
//!    change (which is every `scale_to` at or above the photo's long side, i.e. the native tier).
//!
//! # Why the resampler is Pillow's formulation
//!
//! `finish_source` downscales with `fast_image_resize`'s Lanczos3, which is a Pillow-derived
//! convolution: `support = 3 · max(in/out, 1)`, taps from `(int)(centre − support + 0.5)` to
//! `(int)(centre + support + 0.5)`, weights `lanczos3((k − centre + 0.5) / filter_scale)`
//! normalised to sum 1, u8 between the two passes. This shader is that formulation, written out.
//! It cannot be byte-identical — `fast_image_resize` accumulates in fixed point with quantised
//! coefficients and this accumulates in `f32` — and the milestone does not ask it to be: the DIMS
//! are the gate, the pixels are a report. What the shared formulation buys is that the residual is
//! a few LSB of quantisation rather than a different picture, which is what makes the tile-seam
//! hunt able to see a real defect through it.
//!
//! # INERT
//!
//! Nothing that ships calls this. It is reachable only from `falcon-hwdec` and that crate is a
//! workspace member for `cargo test --workspace` and nothing else.

    /// arm published at 86/80 ms against the CPU arm's 73/66, and the hypothesis was the extra
    /// bytes — the managed contract reads back 4 bytes per pixel (195 MB at 48 MP) where the source
    /// contract read 3 (146 MB), and that device→host burst shares one adapter with the renderer's
    /// own host→device upload.
    ///
    /// WHAT GROUNDING CORRECTED. The two transfers cannot overlap FOR THE SAME FRAME and never
    /// could: this function runs on a decode worker and returns a `Vec`, and only then does
    /// `det_tx` carry the frame to the U1 upload thread. So the spec's stated minimum ("the readback
    /// must not overlap the renderer's own upload of the SAME frame") holds structurally at tip.
    /// What the frame actually paid was SERIAL: one ~195 MB DMA, and THEN one ~195 MB CPU copy out
    /// of the mapped range — each ~20–25 ms at 48 MP, one after the other, plus a single ~195 MB
    /// host-visible allocation to hold it.
    ///
    /// SO THIS PIPELINES THE PAIR THAT ACTUALLY EXISTS. Two band buffers alternate: band k+1's copy
    /// is submitted BEFORE band k is mapped and drained, so the DMA of one band runs while the CPU
    /// unpacks the previous one. The span becomes ≈ max(DMA, unpack) instead of DMA + unpack, and
    /// the peak host-visible allocation falls from the whole picture to
    /// `2 × band::BAND_TARGET_BYTES` = 32 MiB — which on an iGPU is 32 MiB of SYSTEM RAM instead of
    /// 195 MB, the same shared-memory argument the upload side makes, on the other end of the wire.
    ///
    /// FAIL-SOFT: a picture small enough that `band::plan` answers `whole` takes the v0.8.165 path
    /// verbatim — one buffer, one copy, one map — so the cheap case pays nothing for the machinery.
    /// So does every picture when `FALCON_HEIC_READBACK_BANDS=0` (v0.8.167): that lever is this
