//! v0.8.145 (E2) — **THE STAGE GATE**: the WGSL NV12→RGB8 kernel must be byte-identical to the CPU
//! reference, and both must hit the same pinned digests.
//!
//! Why byte-identity and not a tolerance: Stage 0 measured HEVC decode to be bit-exact (one real
//! 896×1024 tile through NVDEC and through libavcodec came back byte-identical, 0 of 1 376 256
//! bytes different, on two different iOS generations). Every backend the epic can adopt therefore
//! hands back the *same* NV12, and this kernel is the only place a difference could enter. A
//! tolerance here would be a licence for the CPU fallback lane and the hardware lane to render the
//! same photo differently and call it agreement.
//!
//! Three separable failures, three separate assertions:
//!
//!  1. `the_twins_are_byte_identical_on_every_golden_row` — GPU bytes == CPU bytes.
//!  2. `the_golden_digests_hold_on_the_gpu_twin` — GPU digest == the pinned digest. (If only #1
//!     held, both twins could have moved together; if only #2 held, they could agree with the pin
//!     while disagreeing about the bytes they hashed — they cannot, but the pair says so.)
//!  3. `a_perturbed_coefficient_breaks_the_identity` — the gate BITES. A deliberately wrong
//!     coefficient handed to one twin must redden #1, or #1 is comparing nothing.
//!
//! GPU REQUIRED, and NOT skipped on this box: falcon-gpu's harness runs on the owner's RTX 5080.
//! The graceful skip below exists only for a genuinely adapter-less machine (headless CI), the same
//! convention `shader_compile.rs` already uses — a skip that ever fires HERE is a finding, so it
//! prints loudly.
